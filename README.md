# quizAppProject
This GitHub file contains components of an interactive, fully functional iOS application - a short 10-question quiz regarding the history of computer science and iOS/Apple.

The Object-Oriented Programming project uses Swift and SwiftUI as the foundation and comes with multiple layers - a welcome screen, questions and a screen that displays the final result. 

Layers/files are designed based on the concepts of MVVM Architecture (Model-View-ViewModel), where: Mode == Data, View == UI and ViewModel == Interface. 

The design process also follows the principle of API design, whereas in this project it's rather about how two different components inside of a program interact with each other instead of two individual programs.

Other basic knowledge applied here include: Struct, Libraries, Stored/Computed Properties, etc.

The application is not intended for commercial-use but rather personal practice and enriching portfolio.
